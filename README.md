## Project Overview
The Heart Attack Prediction project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models capable of predicting the risk of heart attacks. The project uses a comprehensive dataset to explore various factors influencing heart health and applies multiple machine-learning techniques to predict heart attack risk.

## Dataset
The dataset contains various attributes related to heart health, including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, rest ECG results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of significant vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and thalassemia.

## Models Explored
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Ada Boost Classifier
- XGBoost
- Neural Network

## Key Findings
- The project revealed significant predictors of heart attack risk, highlighting the importance of various physiological and medical factors.
- Machine learning models showed promising results in predicting heart attack risk, with some models achieving high accuracy.
- The performance of the models indicates the potential of machine learning in supporting healthcare professionals in diagnosing and preventing heart attacks.

## Conclusion
The Heart Attack Prediction project demonstrates the capability of machine learning models to predict heart attack risk. However, the team notes the importance of further validation of unseen data to ensure the models' generalizability and applicability in real-world scenarios.

## Future Work
- Further refine models to address overfitting and improve prediction accuracy.
- Validate the models on a broader and more diverse dataset to ensure their effectiveness across different populations.
- Explore the integration of these models into healthcare systems for proactive heart health management.
